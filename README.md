# Black'n'white Dotfiles
I realized that my dotfiles needed an update but I was too lazy lol so I might as well redo them! 

## My dotfiles contain my configs of:
+ i3 (
+ polybar
+ alacritty
+ bspwm + sxhkd (comes from beltza i just edited them a little: https://github.com/beltzawoo/dotfiles)
+ zathura
+ discord custom css
+ gtk system theme
+ nvim (the config is a bit big but I will try to put it on github)

i use a black and white theme

## Requirements to ensure the proper functioning of the configs

[I'll do the rest later:/]
