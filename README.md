# Dotfiles
I realized that my dotfiles needed an update but I was too lazy lol so I might as well redo them! 

#My dotfiles contain my configs of:
+i3
+polybar
+alacritty
+bspwm + sxhkd (comes from beltza i just edited them a little: https://github.com/beltzawoo/dotfiles)
+zathura
+discord custom css
+gtk system theme
+nvim (the config is a bit big but I will try to put it on github)

i used a color theme named rosebox but i don't remember the creator (sorry :c)
